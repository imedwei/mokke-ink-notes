     * [force] distinguishes two cadences of refresh:
     *  - `false` (default) — "please keep the overlay's shadow buffer in
     *    sync; the host's own SurfaceView commit will drive the EPD
     *    refresh." Appropriate for scroll: the SurfaceFlinger compose
     *    following drawToSurface recomposites all layers, naturally
     *    reflecting the new bitmap.
     *  - `true` — "the host's SurfaceView commit alone won't make this
     *    visible; force a refresh." Appropriate for delete/snap/diagram

     *    freshly-composed SurfaceView and the host-side compose doesn't
     *    cycle the EPD over the overlay layer.
     *
     * Each controller implements as fits its hardware: the Onyx overlay
     * cycles setRawDrawingEnabled(false)/(true); the Bigme overlay blits
     * the bitmap into its ION buffer and inValidates with a partial-
     * refresh waveform; Canvas/Noop are no-ops (SurfaceView is already
     * the source of truth).
     *
     * IMPORTANT: [bitmap] must already reflect the post-mutation state.
     * Force a synchronous rebuild before calling — the normal drawToSurface
     * coalesces the rebuild through Choreographer, and syncing from an
     * un-rebuilt bitmap produces stale EPD content.
